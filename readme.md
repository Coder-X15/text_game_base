# TextGameBase - an Engine to program text-based/prompt-based games more efficiently

I know it sounds absurd but I'm still gonna do it because I like making stuff and this is something that I'd like to try and make so that anyone can develop a text-based game quite easily.

## Features:
1. Hassle-free development
2. Easy modelling of levels/scenes
3. Ability for users to add text-art into the games they develop
4. Utilizes CMake for making the game executable  __(wolf whistles)__
5. You can add something here when you find it.
